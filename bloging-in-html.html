Bloging in HTML
</title>

<p>
I'm the ultimate procastinator and I can and have used every excuse not to write content consistently. I'm doing it write now: switching from one framework to another constantly, instead of using that time to actually write, which is what I say I want to do.

<p>
When it comes to bloging, some people use bloging platforms (Medium, Wordpress, etc). I really dislike those. I find there editors bloated and that they do not help me get concentrated or in a writing flow. I have tried to write in and editor such as VIM and then copy the result, but that process is also time consuming; formatting does not translate well, and it takes time (and a lot of clicks to leave everything ready).
