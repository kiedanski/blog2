<h1> Cardav Server </h1>

<p>
Keeping track of contacts does not sound like much, but it is very ingrained in
all Google's and Apple's offerings. Most applications rely on this, and if you
are not using Facebook, you better track your friend's birthday's in an app.

<p>
Most contacts and calendar applicaitons rely on widely use protocols to store
and transfer information: CardDav for contacts and CalDav for calendar events.
You need a server running these two protocols, and a way to have your devices
access them and you can replace your default big tech alternatives.

The hardest part about this process is deciding which implementation to use, and
where to deploy it. I ran a home server that I can access remotely using
Tailscale, so this was not a problem to me. It took me a bit longer to decide
which application to use. Radicale is recommened quite often in the web, same as
Baikal. I started going the Radicale route, but I ran into some issues when I
tried to sync to my linux laptop - the program that I was using for sync
complained that Radicale's implemntation was not "complete" and lacked features.
In the end I ended up going for Xandikos behind an Ngix proxy.

Uploading my contacts was not hard. I configured the new account on my phone,
exported my current contacts as a .vfc file, and re-imported it into the new
account. This worked like a charm. I'm still in the inital stages of using
Xandikos but thus far it seems to be working quite well.
