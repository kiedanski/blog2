<h2> Building2025 - Automatic News - Day 1 </h2>

<p>
Ok, so the first project that I'm building as part of this 52-week, 26-project challenge is a pipeline that takes news and summarizes them for me, so that I can have more actionable information. The idea is that I'm just going to subscribe to a bunch of news and hopefully only use this as a way of processing them.
</p>

<p>The original idea is to have everything arrive at an inbox and then use AI to extract everything and then dump it into Notion. I tried to build the first part of that using pure bash and running everything on my local Raspberry Pi; programming everything from scratch. But that took a while; I was not very inspired.
</p>

<p>Next, I went with a low-code tool; I used Make, and I managed to get everything working. It triggers when an email arrives to my inbox, runs that through ChatGPT, extracts information - that part is not working very well because my current prompt sucks.  Finanlly, it writes everything into Notion as separate items.</p>

<p>My first impression is that it's just not very good at capturing the escence of what was shared. I need to be more explicit about what I want. One thing I'm going to do is to extract only events such as webinars, or in-person events, and get all the relevant information, such as the link for joining, if there's a date, a date. When that works, I'm going to try to do two things: one, add it to my calendar; two, rewrite a shareable thing so I can actually share more events with the network. So that's going to be my first goal, I think.
</p>

<p>
After that, I will try to slowly add extract more categories of information: projects, news, and more.
