For a long time, I've been wanting to create something. I have this mild instinct or urge to create something, and spend sometime coding. I usually get a surge of energy, and I start building something, but it usually ends with half-baked projects that nobody sees, and I don't use. That's is getting annoying, and my goal for 2025 is to fix that.
</p>

<p>
I feel that it would be really interesting for me to showcase, build, and share some of the ideas that I have, but I've been lacking a formal structure or plan to do so. One thing that has been limiting me is the fact that the ideas I have, and in a way, my creativity, are not 100% aligned with my day job, nor my so-called passions or objectives in life. And this is to say, I have some ideas that are not necessarily related to AI, and so speaking about them, for example on LinkedIn, could be weird because hey, you're the AI guy but you're not talking about AI, what's going on?
</p>

<p>
Similarly, I want to dedicate most of my life to fighting climate change but for reasons beyond my comprehension, my creativity sometimes doesn't go in that direction, and so I might have an idea that's completely related to small businesses and e-commerce; it has little or no AI, has little or nothing to do with climate change, and leaves me thinking: does it even make sense for me to build it?

<p>
At the same time, there's sort of this urge to go and build, so I decided to take a new approach starting in 2025. I'm going to take a page from the indie hacker playbook - Peter Levels (author of Make, go and read that book) - and I'm going to build and ship 26 ideas in one year (one every two weeks). Two weeks is a very short time to go and build something that's reliable. I'm going to have to focus quite a bit on the core of every idea and think only in terms of MVPs, something that as an engineer by training, I often find quite hard. 
</p>

<p>
As for the projects, I expect that some ideas will be horrible and never take off. Some ideas will resonate with some people, and I might need to keep on maintaining some of them as time goes by. Those are problems for the future, step 1 is to build consistently. If by month six, there's a couple that work, I might spend some of my time prioritizing them in-lieu of new ones. That's the plan so far.</p>

<p>My idea is to keep a build journal, an to update the public where I am, what I am thinking, and how things turn out to be. I'm really searching for ways to be away from screens all the time, so I'm going to be recording my build logs and transcribing them, hopefully with some edits in between.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that I'm really curious about is what happens when I build something, and that something actually starts working a little bit. How much will I be able to use AI to automate the process and sort of keep it going with as little momentum as possible? Regarding my objectives, part of it is just proving that I can build stuff, so that's going to be one of the main motivations. I also want to prove to myself that I could make money online if needed. In this regard, so some of these ideas will have some sort of profit structure attached to them, or at least, I'm going to try to think about it. Regardless of whether I end up making a business out of them, I definitely want to keep the initiative going, and that's going to involve server costs, infrastructure, and cloud, so hopefully, the goal is to make enough money to have all the projects on the initiative as a whole be self-sufficient without me having to sort of spend money to keep the project going.</p>

<p>And that's it, that's the goal, and hopefully I will keep on updating this very frequently. We'll see if I manage to keep my word.</p>
